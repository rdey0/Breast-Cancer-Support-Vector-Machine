# Cancer Classifier Application

[Running Instance](https://rdey0.github.io/cancer_classifier/)

Customize your own machine learning model to detect the presence of cancer. This cancer classifier uses a support vector machine trained on data and hyperparameters of your choosing. Play around and see what combinations of data sets and hyperparameters allow you to produce the most accurate classifications.

# How it was Made

React was used as the front-end framework. The machine learning algorithms were written in python and are run on a Node.js server. The Node server runs the python scripts and returns the resulting graph and outcome metrics via API calls.
